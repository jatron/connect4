Play connect four in the comfort of your terminal.

Player types are HUMANPLAYER, NETWORKPLAYER, and MINIMAXPLAYER.
Player difficulties are HARD, NORMAL, and EASY.
Ports and address are only used in network games.
Player difficulties are only used in case of using an AI.
When playing as a HUMANPLAYER, you can input `save <savefile>` to save the game and exit your client or `exit` to exit your client.

Usage:
  play.py [--debugging] [--verbose] load <savefile>
  play.py [--time-limit=TIMEINSECONDS]
          [--local-port=PORT] [--peer-address=ADDRESS] [--peer-port=PORT]
          [--debugging] [--verbose]
          [--p1-difficulty=DIFFICULTY] [--p2-difficulty=DIFFICULTY]
          [--missy-mode]
          <playertype> vs <playertype>
  play.py (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this screen.
  --time-limit=TIMEINSECONDS  Maximum allowed time per player move in seconds [default: 180].
  --local-port=PORT           Local port [default: 3500].
  --peer-address=ADDRESS      Peer player's IP address.
  --peer-port=PORT            Peer player's port [default: 3500].
  --p1-difficulty=DIFFICULTY  First player difficulty [default: NORMAL].
  --p2-difficulty=DIFFICULTY  Second player difficulty [default: NORMAL].
  --missy-mode                Missy mode.
  -d --debugging              Save debugging log.
  -v --verbose                Turn on verbose output mode.
